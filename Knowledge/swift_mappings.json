        "**Provide suggestions to make searching easier.** When you display a person\u02bcs recent searches or offer search suggestions both before and while they\u2019re typing, you can help people search faster and type less. For developer guidance, see [searchSuggestions(_:)](/documentation/SwiftUI/View/searchSuggestions(_:)).",
        "**Take privacy into consideration before displaying search history.** People might not appreciate having their search history appear where others might see it. Depending on the context, consider providing other ways to narrow the search instead. If you do show search history, provide a way for people to clear it if they want.",
        "**Make your app\u2019s content searchable in Spotlight.** You can share content with Spotlight by making it indexable and specifying descriptive attributes known as *metadata*. Spotlight extracts, stores, and organizes this information to allow for fast, comprehensive searches.",
        "**Define metadata for custom file types you handle.** Supply a Spotlight File Importer plug-in that describes the types of metadata your file format contains. For developer guidance, see [CSImportExtension](/documentation/CoreSpotlight/CSImportExtension).",
        "**Use Spotlight to offer advanced file-search capabilities within the context of your app.** For example, you might include a button that instantly initiates a Spotlight search based on the current selection. You might then display a custom view that presents the search results or a filtered subset of them.",
        "**Prefer using the system-provided open and save views.** The system-provided open and save views generally include a built-in search field that people can use to search and filter the entire system. For related guidance, see [File management](/design/human-interface-guidelines/file-management).",
        "**Implement a Quick Look generator if your app produces custom file types.** A Quick Look generator helps Spotlight and other apps show previews of your documents. For developer guidance, see [Quick Look](/documentation/QuickLook)."

      "abstract": "People expect apps and games to just work, but they also appreciate having ways to customize the experience to fit their needs.",
      "guidelines": [
        "**Aim to provide default settings that give the best experience to the largest number of people.** For example, you can automatically maximize performance for the device your game is running on instead of asking players to make this choice after your game launches (for developer guidance, see [Improving your game\u2019s graphics performance and settings](/documentation/Metal/improving-your-games-graphics-performance-and-settings)). When you choose appropriate default settings, people may not have to make any adjustments before they can start enjoying your app or game.",
        "**Minimize the number of settings you offer.** Although people appreciate having control over an app or game, too many settings can make the experience feel less approachable, while also making it hard to find a particular setting.",
        "**Make settings available in ways people expect.** For example, when a physical keyboard is connected, people often use the standard Command-Comma (,) keyboard shortcut to open an app\u2019s settings, whereas in a game, players often use the Esc (Escape) key.",
        "**Avoid using settings to ask for setup information you can get in other ways.** For example, a game can automatically detect a connected controller or accessory instead of asking the player to identify it; an app can detect whether people are currently using Dark Mode.",
        "**Respect people\u2019s systemwide settings and avoid including redundant versions of them in your custom settings area.** People expect to use the system-provided Settings app to manage global options like accessibility accommodations, scrolling behavior, and authentication methods, and they expect all apps and games to adhere to their choices. Including custom versions of global options in your settings area is likely to confuse people because it implies that systemwide settings may not apply to your app or game and that changing your custom version of a global setting may affect other apps and games, too.",
        "**Put general, infrequently changed settings in your custom settings area.** People must suspend what they\u2019re doing to open an app\u2019s or game\u2019s settings area, so you want to include options that people don\u2019t need to change all the time. For example, an app might list options for adjusting window configuration; a game might let players specify game-saving behavior or keyboard mappings; both apps and games might offer options related to people\u2019s accounts.",
        "**When possible, prefer letting people modify task-specific options without going to your settings area.** For example, if people can adjust things like showing or hiding parts of the current view, reordering a collection of items, or filtering a list, make these options available in the screens they affect, where they\u2019re discoverable and convenient. Putting this type of option in a separate settings area disconnects it from its context, requiring people to suspend their task to make adjustments, and often hiding the results until people resume the task.",
        "**Add only the most rarely changed options to the system-provided Settings app.** If it makes sense to add your app\u2019s or game\u2019s settings to the system-provided Settings app, consider providing a button that opens it directly from your interface.",
        "**Include a settings item in the [App menu](/design/human-interface-guidelines/the-menu-bar#App-menu).** Avoid adding settings buttons to a window\u2019s toolbar, because doing so decreases the space available for essential commands that people use frequently. If you provide document-level options, add this item to your app\u2019s [File menu](/design/human-interface-guidelines/the-menu-bar#File-menu).",
        "**Dim a settings window\u2019s minimize and maximize buttons.** It\u2019s quick to open a custom settings window using the standard Command\u2013Comma (,) keyboard command, so there\u2019s no need to keep the window in the Dock, and because a settings window accommodates the size of the current pane, people don\u2019t need to expand the window to see more.",
        "**In your settings window, use a noncustomizable toolbar that remains visible and always indicates the active toolbar button.** A settings window\u2019s toolbar identifies the areas people can customize and helps people navigate among those areas. People rely on a stable settings interface to help them find what they need.",
        "**Update the window\u2019s title to reflect the currently visible pane.** If your settings window doesn\u2019t have multiple panes, use the title *App Name* Settings.",
        "**Restore the most recently viewed pane.** People often adjust related settings more than once, so it can be convenient when a settings window opens to the last pane people used."

        "**If the platform requires it, provide a launch screen.** In iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS, the system displays your launch screen the moment your app or game starts and quickly replaces it with your first screen, giving people the impression that your experience is fast and responsive. For guidance, see [Launch screens](/design/human-interface-guidelines/launching#Launch-screens). macOS, visionOS, and watchOS don\u2019t require launch screens.",
        "**If you need a splash screen, consider displaying it at the beginning of your onboarding flow.** A splash screen is a beautiful graphic that succinctly communicates branding and other information you need to provide. If you don\u2019t provide an onboarding experience, you might display your splash screen as soon as launching completes.",
        "**Restore the previous state when your app restarts so people can continue where they left off.** Avoid making people retrace steps to reach their previous location in your app or game. Restore granular details of the previous state as much as possible. For example, scroll the view to people\u2019s most recent position, and display windows in the same state and location in which people left them.",
        "**Downplay the launch experience.** A launch screen isn\u2019t part of an onboarding experience or a splash screen, and it isn\u2019t an opportunity for artistic expression. A launch screen\u2019s sole function is to enhance the perception of your experience as quick to launch and immediately ready to use.",
        "**Design a launch screen that\u2019s nearly identical to the first screen of your app or game.** If you include elements that look different when launching completes, people may experience an unpleasant flash between the launch screen and your first screen. If your app or game displays a solid color before transitioning to the first screen, create a launch screen that displays only that solid color. Also make sure that your launch screen matches the device\u2019s current orientation and appearance mode.",
        "**Avoid including text on your launch screen, even if your first screen displays text.** Because the content in a launch screen doesn\u2019t change, any text you display won\u2019t be localized.",
        "**Don\u2019t advertise.** The launch screen isn\u2019t a branding opportunity. Avoid creating a screen that looks like a splash screen or an \u201cAbout\u201d window, and don\u2019t include logos or other branding elements unless they\u2019re a fixed part of your app\u2019s first screen.",
        "**Launch in the appropriate orientation.** If your app or game supports both portrait and landscape modes, launch using the device\u2019s current orientation. If your interface only runs in one orientation, launch in that orientation and let people rotate the device if necessary. Ensure a landscape-only interface responds correctly, regardless of whether people enter landscape orientation by rotating the device left or right. For guidance, see [Layout](/design/human-interface-guidelines/layout).",
        "**In a live-viewing app, consider automatically starting playback soon after people start the app.** People come to your app to watch TV, so you might want to start playing new or recently viewed live content after a few seconds of inactivity. For guidance, see [Live-viewing apps](/design/human-interface-guidelines/live-viewing-apps).",
        "**Consider launching in the Shared Space even if your app is fully immersive.** Opening a window in the Shared Space lets you provide more context about your app or game while giving it time to load, and it also lets you present a control that people can use to open your fully immersive experience. In general, people appreciate being able to choose when to transition to a Full Space, especially if they\u2019re currently running other apps in the Shared Space. For guidance, see [Immersive experiences](/design/human-interface-guidelines/immersive-experiences)."
