You can also use symbolic traits to adjust leading if you need to improve readability or conserve space. For example, when you display text in wide columns or long passages, more space between lines (*loose leading*) can make it easier for people to keep their place while moving from one line to the next. Conversely, if you need to display multiple lines of text in an area where height is constrained — for example, in a list row — decreasing the space between lines (*tight leading*) can help the text fit well.

If you don’t rotate text to remain facing the wearer, the text can become impossible to read because people may view it from the side or a highly oblique angle. For example, imagine a virtual lamp that appears to be on a physical desk with a label anchored directly above it.

For example, Weather displays text that summarizes the information people need right now — such as “Chance of light rain in the next hour” — above the scrolling list of hourly forecasts for the next 24 hours.

For example, the Health Trends screen shows small charts that each use a specific visual style to depict a recent trend in an area like steps or resting heart rate. When people choose a chart to reveal all their data in that area, the expanded version uses the same style, colors, marks, and annotations to strengthen the relationship between the versions."

In macOS, for example, the Finder asks for confirmation when people drag a file into a write-only folder because they won’t be able to open the folder and remove the dropped item. In some situations, it might make sense to provide a way to reverse the results of drag and drop when people can’t undo it.

If your app supports these behaviors, let people use their preferred gestures to perform them. If the systemwide double-tap settings don’t make sense in your app, you can still use the gesture to change the interaction mode.

In this scenario, there are only a small number of items within one discrete step of the previously focused item, so moving focus to one of these remaining items ensures that the focus indicator is in a location people can easily find.

Unlike classic programming, small changes to inputs (or even the same input, when given multiple times) often produce very different outcomes with generative AI.

For example, if you generate images or descriptions of people, ask people to provide the information needed for the feature to work well rather than solely inferring personal or cultural characteristics. Seek clarity before making assumptions that may lead to common stereotypes, such as about gender identities or relationship types. Test your feature across a diverse set of people to identify and correct stereotypes, and ensure inclusive results.

In other cases, AI may play a complementary role that enhances your app’s core functionality, but isn’t critical for people achieving their goals. For example, Genmoji offers a fun way to create new, original emoji, but people can still use regular emoji too. The Apple Intelligence summarization feature makes catching up with notifications faster, but people can still read notifications without it. When possible, consider offering a non-AI fallback so people can always enjoy your app or game."

A person can opt out of this behavior by enabling Direct Gesture mode, which disables standard VoiceOver gestures and lets apps process hand input directly.

The first way is to use accessibility APIs (such as [accessibilityRespondsToUserInteraction(_:)](/documentation/SwiftUI/View/accessibilityRespondsToUserInteraction(_:))) to specify a logical and predictable path through your chart’s information. For example, you might want to let people navigate along the X axis instead of jumping back and forth. The second way — which is particularly useful if you need to present a very large dataset — is to let people move focus among subsets of values instead of navigating through all individual data points.

You might also consider shifting the Y axis to the trailing side of the chart so that its tick labels don’t protrude past the chart’s leading edge.

On the Lock Screen and in the Smart Stack in watchOS, the system shows a Live Activity for up to four hours after it ends. Depending on the duration of your Live Activity, showing a summary in your Lock Screen presentation may only be relevant for a brief time after it ends. For example, a rideshare app could end the Live Activity when a ride completes and configure it to remain on the Lock Screen for 30 minutes — long enough for people to view the ride summary and leave a tip for the driver. Consider choosing a custom removal time that’s proportional to the duration of your Live Activity. In most cases, 15 to 30 minutes is adequate."
