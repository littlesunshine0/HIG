On devices that support background tag reading, the system automatically looks for nearby compatible tags whenever the screen is illuminated. After detecting and matching a tag with an app, the system shows a notification that the people can tap to send the tag data to the app for processing. Note that background reading isn’t available when an NFC scanning sheet is visible, Wallet or Apple Pay are in use, cameras are in use, the device is in Airplane Mode, and the device is locked after a restart."
