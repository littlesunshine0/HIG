For example, a calendar event popover makes it easy for people to change the date or time of an event, or to move it to another calendar. The popover disappears after the change, letting people continue reviewing the events on their calendar."

Otherwise, a popover generally closes when people click or tap outside its bounds or select an item in the popover. If multiple selections are possible, make sure the popover remains open until people explicitly dismiss it or they click or tap outside its bounds."
