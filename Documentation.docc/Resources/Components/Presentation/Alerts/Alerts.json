For example, when a server connection is unavailable, Mail displays an indicator that people can choose to learn more."

In comparison, when people take an uncommon destructive action that they can’t undo, it’s important to display an alert in case they initiated the action accidentally."

If your app detects a problem at startup, like no network connection, consider alternative ways to let people know. For example, you could show cached or placeholder data and a nonintrusive label that describes the problem."

As much as possible, describe what happened, the context in which it happened, and why. Avoid writing a title that doesn’t convey useful information — like “Error” or “Error 329347 occurred” — but also avoid overly long titles that wrap to more than two lines. If the title is a complete sentence, use [sentence-style capitalization](https://help.apple.com/applestyleguide/#/apsgb744e4a3?sub=apdca93e113f1d64) and appropriate ending punctuation. If the title is a sentence fragment, use title-style capitalization, and don’t add ending punctuation."

Prefer verbs and verb phrases that relate directly to the alert text — for example, “View All,” “Reply,” or “Ignore.” In informational alerts only, you can use “OK” for acceptance, avoiding “Yes” and “No.” Always use “Cancel” to title a button that cancels the alert’s action.

For example, does “OK” mean “OK, I want to complete the action” or “OK, I now understand the negative results my action would have caused”? A specific button title like “Erase,” “Convert,” “Clear,” or “Delete” helps people understand the action they’re taking."

Always place the default button on the trailing side of a row or at the top of a stack. Cancel buttons are typically on the leading side of a row or at the bottom of a stack."

In this scenario, the convenience of pressing Return to confirm the deliberately chosen Empty Trash action outweighs the benefit of reaffirming that the button is destructive. In contrast, people appreciate an alert that draws their attention to a button that can perform a destructive action they didn’t originally intend."

          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "**If there’s a destructive action, include a Cancel button to give people a clear, safe way to avoid the action.** Always use the title “Cancel” for a button that cancels an alert’s action. Note that you don’t want to make a Cancel button the default button. If you want to encourage people to read an alert and not just automatically press Return to dismiss it, avoid making any button the default button. Similarly, if you must display an alert with a single button that’s also the default, use a Done button, not a Cancel button."

Although an alert can also help people confirm or cancel an action that has destructive consequences, it doesn’t provide additional choices related to the action.
