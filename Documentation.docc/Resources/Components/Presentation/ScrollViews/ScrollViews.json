On most platforms, you can define the size of such a *page* — typically the current height or width of the view — and define an interaction that scrolls one page at a time. To help maintain context during page-by-page scrolling, you can define a unit of overlap, such as a line of text, a row of glyphs, or part of a picture, and subtract the unit from the page size.

In most cases, the system applies a scroll edge effect automatically when a pinned element overlaps with scrolling content.

When people look at the scroll indicator and begin a drag gesture, the indicator enables a jog bar experience that lets people manipulate the scrolling speed instead of the content’s position. In this experience, the scroll indicator reveals tick marks that speed up or slow down as people make small adjustments to their gesture, providing visual feedback that helps people precisely control scrolling acceleration."

If you place tab views in a vertical stack, people can rotate the Digital Crown to move vertically through full-screen pages of content. In this scenario, the system displays a page indicator next to the Digital Crown that shows people where they are in the content, both within the current page and within a set of pages.

However, if your app has long pages, people can still use the Digital Crown both to navigate between shorter pages and to scroll content in a longer page because the page indicator expands into a scroll indicator when necessary. Use variable-height pages judiciously and place them after fixed-height pages when possible."
