Stack multiple text fields vertically when possible, and use consistent widths to create a more organized layout. For example, the first and last name fields on an address form might be one width, while the address and city fields might be a different width."

The appropriate time to check the data depends on the context: when entering an email address, it’s best to validate when people switch to another field; when creating a user name or password, validation needs to happen before people switch to another field."

It can also display the value in a specific way, such as with a certain number of decimal places, as a percentage, or as currency. Don’t assume the actual presentation of data, however, as formatting can vary significantly based on people’s locale."
