A slider that adjusts image size, for example, could show a small image icon on the left and a large image icon on the right."

For example, people expect to be able to move a horizontal slider that represents a percentage from 0 percent on the leading side to 100 percent on the trailing side."

For related guidance, see [Text fields](/design/human-interface-guidelines/text-fields) and [Steppers](/design/human-interface-guidelines/steppers)."

For example, a graphics app might offer a horizontal slider for setting the opacity level of an object between 0 and 100 percent. Use circular sliders when values repeat or continue indefinitely. For example, a graphics app might use a circular slider to adjust the rotation of an object between 0 and 360 degrees. An animation app might use a circular slider to adjust how many times an object spins when animated — four complete rotations equals four spins, or 1440 degrees of rotation."

It’s unnecessary to label every tick mark unless doing so is needed to reduce confusion. In many cases, labeling only the minimum and maximum values is sufficient. When the values of the slider are nonlinear, like in the Energy Saver settings pane, periodic labels provide context. It’s also a good idea to provide a [tooltip](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/offering-help#macOS-visionOS) that displays the value of the thumb when people hold their pointer over it."
