If necessary, give people control over beginning and ending Live Activities with buttons. However, it can make sense to automatically initiate a Live Activity if a person starts a task or event. For example, ordering food for delivery or making a rideshare request could automatically start a Live Activity. Similarly, a sports app could offer a Live Activity that starts automatically for every match of a person’s favorite team. On devices that run iOS 17.2 and iPad OS 17.2 and later, the Live Activity can start with a remote push notification while the app is in the background.

On the Lock Screen and in the Smart Stack in watchOS, the system shows a Live Activity for up to four hours after it ends. Depending on the duration of your Live Activity, showing a summary in your Lock Screen presentation may only be relevant for a brief time after it ends. For example, a rideshare app could end the Live Activity when a ride completes and configure it to remain on the Lock Screen for 30 minutes — long enough for people to view the ride summary and leave a tip for the driver. Consider choosing a custom removal time that’s proportional to the duration of your Live Activity. In most cases, 15 to 30 minutes is adequate."

For example, a rideshare app might display a more compact Live Activity without additional details while it locates a driver. The app’s height extends as more information is available to display the estimated pickup time, driver details, and so on.
