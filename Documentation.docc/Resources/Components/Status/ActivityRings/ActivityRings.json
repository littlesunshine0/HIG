For example, if you structure a workout or health session around the completion of Activity rings, consider displaying the element on a workout metrics screen so that people can track their progress during their session. Similarly, if you provide a summary screen that appears at the conclusion of a workout, you could display Activity rings to help people check on their progress toward their daily goals."
