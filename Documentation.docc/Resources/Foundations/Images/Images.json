You can visualize scale factor by considering the density of pixels per point in 2D displays of various resolutions. For example, a scale factor of 1 (also called @1x) describes a 1:1 pixel density, where one pixel is equal to one point. High-resolution 2D displays have higher pixel densities, such as 2:1 or 3:1. A 2:1 density (called @2x) has a scale factor of 2, and a 3:1 density (called @3x) has a scale factor of 3. Because of higher pixel densities, high-resolution displays demand images with more pixels."

To help a rasterized image look sharp when people view it from a wide range of distances, you can use a higher resolution, but each increase in resolution results in a larger file size and may impact your app’s runtime performance, especially for resolutions over @6x. If you use images that have resolutions higher than @2x, be sure to also apply high-quality image filtering to help balance quality and performance (for developer guidance, see [filters](/documentation/QuartzCore/CALayer/filters))."
