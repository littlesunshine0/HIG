For example, when a game displays a succinct animation that’s precisely tied to a successful action, players can instantly get the message without being distracted from their gameplay. Another example is in visionOS: When people tap a panorama in Photos, it quickly and smoothly expands to fill the space in front of them, helping them track the transition without making them wait to enjoy the content."
