The exception is when people are moving focus using an input device that lets them make discrete, directional movements — like a keyboard, remote, or game controller — and a previously focused item disappears. In this scenario, there are only a small number of items within one discrete step of the previously focused item, so moving focus to one of these remaining items ensures that the focus indicator is in a location people can easily find. When people aren’t moving focus by using such an input device, you can’t predict the item they’ll target next, so it’s generally best to simply hide the focus indicator when the focused object disappears."

In contrast, tvOS users rely on using directional gestures on a remote or game controller (or pressing the arrow keys on an attached keyboard) to reach every onscreen element, so you need to make sure that people can bring focus to every element in your app."

In contrast, iPadOS defines *focus groups*, which represent specific areas within an app, like a sidebar, grid, or list. Using focus groups, iPadOS can support two different keyboard interactions."

You can also adjust a halo’s position if another component occludes or clips it. For example, you might need to ensure that a badge appears above the halo or that a parent view doesn’t clip it.

For example, if you want focus to move down through a vertical stack of custom views before it moves in the trailing direction to the next view, you need to identify the stack container as a single focus group.
