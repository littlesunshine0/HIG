For example, in an app that supports navigation through a hierarchy of views, people expect to find a Back button in a top toolbar that lets them return to the previous view with a single tap. To help accelerate this action, many apps also offer a shortcut gesture — such as swiping from the side of a window or touchscreen — while continuing to provide the Back button."

In specific circumstances within games or immersive experiences, developers can work around this area by deferring the system gesture.
