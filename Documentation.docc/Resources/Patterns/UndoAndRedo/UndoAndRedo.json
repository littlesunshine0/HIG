In a situation like this, people might not remember which of their previous actions an undo is targeting, which can lead to unintended changes and frustration. To help people remain in control, it’s essential to help people predict the outcome of undoing and redoing and to highlight the results."

If you provide undo and redo menu items, you can modify the menu item labels to identify the result. For example, a document-based app might use menu item labels like Undo Typing or Redo Bold."

          "text": "**Show the results of an undo or redo.** Sometimes, the most recent action that people want to undo affects content or an area that’s no longer visible. In cases like this, it’s crucial to highlight the result of each undo and redo to keep people from thinking that the action had no effect, which can lead them to perform it repeatedly. For example, if people undo after deleting a paragraph in a document area that’s no longer onscreen, you might scroll the document to show the restored paragraph."

          "text": "**Consider giving people the option to revert multiple changes at once.** In some scenarios, people might appreciate the ability to undo a batch of discrete but related actions — like incremental adjustments to a single property or attribute — so they don’t have to undo each individual adjustment. In other cases, it can make sense to give people a convenient way to undo all the changes they made since opening a document or saving their work."

If it’s important to provide dedicated undo and redo buttons in your app, use the standard system-provided symbols and put the buttons in a toolbar."

For example, you might create alert titles such as “Undo Name” or “Redo Address Change.”"
