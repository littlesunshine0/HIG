For developer guidance, see [SecureField](/documentation/SwiftUI/SecureField). In tvOS, you can also configure a [digit entry view](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/digit-entry-views) to obscure the numerals people enter (for developer guidance, see [isSecureDigitEntry](/documentation/TVUIKit/TVDigitEntryViewController/isSecureDigitEntry)). When you use the system-provided text field in visionOS, the system shows the entered data to the wearer, but not to anyone else; for example, a secure text field automatically blurs when people use AirPlay to stream their content."

When you verify values as soon as people enter them — and provide feedback as soon as you detect a problem — you give them the opportunity to correct errors right away. For numeric data in particular, consider using a number formatter, which automatically configures a text field to accept only numeric values. You can also configure a formatter to display the value in a specific way, such as with a certain number of decimal places, as a percentage, or as currency."
