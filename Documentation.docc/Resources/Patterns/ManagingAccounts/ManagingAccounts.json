For developer guidance, see [Supporting passkeys](/documentation/AuthenticationServices/supporting-passkeys). If you need to continue using passwords for authentication, augment security by requiring two-factor authentication (for developer guidance, see [Securing Logins with iCloud Keychain Verification Codes](/documentation/AuthenticationServices/securing-logins-with-icloud-keychain-verification-codes))."
