For example, include a Print item in your macOS app’s File menu; in your iOS or iPadOS app, add a toolbar button that opens an [action sheet](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/action-sheets). If your macOS app has a toolbar, you might want to put a Print button there, too, but consider making it an optional button that people can add when they customize the toolbar."

Give your custom category a unique name, such as your app name, and include options that help people have a great print experience in your app. For example, Keynote offers presentation-specific options, like the ability to print presenter notes, slide backgrounds, and skipped slides."

For example, you don’t need to include options like changing the page orientation or printing in reverse order because the system implements these options."
